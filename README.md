React/Electron Starter was created by Jaret Burkett https://github.com/jaretburkett

                MuddyBootsCode changed a few aspects of it to make it easier for beginners to pick it up and customize it.

                For now all you need to do to use it is:

                1) Clone the project
                2) npm install
                3) npm start

                Then you're off the races.

                more info coming soon.
